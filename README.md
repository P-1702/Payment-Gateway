# Payment-Gateway
An effort to create a payment-gateway between the user and merchant for transactions using razor-pay.
It is facilitated by a django-admin panel that shows a list of transactions along with other necessary details of the user.

NOTE:
The razor-pya key-id pairs used are in test mode. They CANNOT be used for making actual transactions.
